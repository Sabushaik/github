solar heat systems 
soalr cooker systems 
pv cells photo voltaic cells 
it is made up of with 2 layers of silicon 
uppper layer n type 
lower layer p type 
pn junction diode 
between p and n type 
pv cells very much used i n caluculators
weather s
 amounts of cadmium cells 
solar panels also called photo cell
silicon second most abundant material crust (amorphus silicon)
pv arrays made light up a buildin g 
MUNCIPAL SOLID WASTE 
THROUGH THIS MUNCIPAL SOLID SEDIMENT SEWAGE
BURNING OF SOLID WASTE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 
BIO MASS= heat and energy released in combustion is callled as bio mass energy
bio mass is stored sloar energy in the woods
liquid fuel is called bio fuel 
ethanol and ethenol 
heat and energy 
gas like methane 
bio fuel ethanol methonal 
burning of bio mass = { co2 , co , cfc} 
fossil fuels on combstion gives so2 co2 co etc so2 is very less co also less but co2 is in huge amount 
 vegetable oils is diesel ... production 
jatropha is a crop where we get bio diesel
